 get catch data

head(catch_df)

```

`select`the columns we need for analysis
`gather` to move from wide to long
```{r use gather spread}
catch_clean<-catch_df %>% 
    #select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum) %>% 
    select(-All,-notesRegCode) %>% 
    gather(key="Species", value="catch",-Region,-Year) %>% 
    ##opposite of gather is spread (to put it back the way it was)
    #spread(key="Species", value="catch")##key is what you turn into column names
    rename(catch_thousands=catch)
    head(catch_clean)
    ##we want to gather over the species columns ... is selection of columns
```
